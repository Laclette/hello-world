# hello-world
I just started learning how to code 10/27/2020. This will be a place to store my ideas and store resources. It seems that eventually I'll be able to collaborate with others. 
I like reading and learning new things. I still haven't found the purpose of my life, maybe there isn't one... but I'll try to continue searching for it.
